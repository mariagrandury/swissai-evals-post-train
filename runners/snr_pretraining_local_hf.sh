# SNR pretraining runner — vLLM eval against locally-staged HF checkpoints
# (the converted-from-Megatron snapshots under
#  /iopsstor/scratch/cscs/mariagrandury/snr-hf-checkpoints/).
#
# Uses local paths instead of snr-models HF URLs so we skip the HF API
# round-trip entirely (dodges 429 rate-limits during a large sweep, and
# avoids re-downloading several GB per ckpt). The container mounts
# /iopsstor so the path resolves inside the eval container.
#
# Submit through:
#   bash scripts/launch_evaluations.sh snr-pretraining-full \
#       --script runners/snr_pretraining_local_hf.sh --time 06:00:00
#
# Each (cell, iter) becomes one sbatch via hf_base_runner.sh; per-task
# idempotency in evaluate.sbatch skips checkpoints already evaluated.
